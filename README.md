> **HomeLedger** is a free, open-source, self-hosted personal finance manager — an expense tracker and budgeting app you run on your own server. Track bank accounts, income and expenses, budgets, savings goals, subscriptions and net worth, with a Home Assistant add-on and one-command Docker deployment.

HomeLedger is a **self-hosted personal finance app** for people who want to own their financial data instead of trusting it to a cloud service — a privacy-friendly, open-source alternative to Mint, YNAB or Monarch. It runs anywhere Docker runs (home server, VPS, NAS, homelab or Raspberry Pi) and optionally integrates with **Home Assistant** as an add-on and HACS integration. Bilingual (English / Spanish) with a configurable install currency.

### Dashboard

A complete financial overview: net worth, income vs. expenses, spending by
category, account health, upcoming payments, goals and budgets at a glance.

![HomeLedger dashboard populated with demo data](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)

### Transactions

Income and expenses split into two columns and grouped by month, with a
card grid view and quick filtering.

![Transactions screen showing demo income and expense cards](docs/screenshots/transactions.png)

### Budgets &amp; Goals

Category budgets with allocation-vs-spent progress, and savings goals that turn
objectives into visible progress (fund / withdraw / debt payoff).

## Quick Start

The fastest way to run HomeLedger is Docker — no toolchain to install. For local
development from source (Node) see **[Development](#development)**.

### Docker (recommended for production)

**Option 1 — Prebuilt image from Docker Hub**

A multi-arch image is published to Docker Hub on every push to `main`. The
image is self-contained: a single process serves both the web app and the API
on port 3000, so it runs with no extra command.

```bash
docker pull irving1flores/homeledger:latest

docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v homeledger-data:/data \
  -e JWT_SECRET="your-strong-random-secret-min-32-chars" \
  -e ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@homeledger.local" \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-strong-password" \
  -e DEFAULT_LOCALE="en" \
  -e DISPLAY_CURRENCY="USD" \
  --name homeledger \
  irving1flores/homeledger:latest



# Then open http://localhost:3000 and log in with the email/password above.
```
bash
# 1. 停止容器
docker compose down

# 2. 將 ./data 的擁有者改為 UID 1000
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./data

# 3. 重新啟動容器
docker compose up -d


**What each flag does** (only `JWT_SECRET` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are required — omit the rest to take the defaults):

| Flag | What it does | Your options |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| `-p 3000:3000` | Publishes the app + API on host port 3000. Without it the container runs but you can't reach it. | Any `HOST:3000` (e.g. `-p 8080:3000` to use `localhost:8080`) |
| `-v homeledger-data:/data` | Persists the SQLite DB + attachments in a named volume, so data survives rebuilds. | A named volume, or a host path (`-v /my/folder:/data`) |
| `-e JWT_SECRET=…` | **Required.** Random secret (≥32 chars) used to sign login tokens. | Any long random string |
| `-e ADMIN_EMAIL=…` | Email for the first admin user, created on first run. | Any email (default `admin@homeledger.local`) |
| `-e ADMIN_PASSWORD=…` | **Required.** Password for that admin. | A strong password |
| `-e DEFAULT_LOCALE=…` | Starting UI language + the language your default categories are seeded in. Each user can change their own later in **Settings**. | `en` or `es` (default `en`) |
| `-e DISPLAY_CURRENCY=…` | The install's single currency (symbol + unit for all amounts; no conversion). Admin can change it in-app. | `MXN` `USD` `EUR` `COP` `ARS` `CLP` `PEN` `BRL` (default `MXN`) |

> :bulb: The `\` at the end of each line is a **bash** line-continuation. On
> **Windows PowerShell**, use a backtick `` ` `` instead, or put the whole
> `docker run` on a single line.
>
> The first account created becomes the admin. `DEFAULT_LOCALE` / `DISPLAY_CURRENCY`
> are optional — see the full [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) table.

### Run from Docker Desktop (no command line)

The image ships with built-in demo defaults, so you don't need to set any
environment variables — but you **must** map the port, otherwise the browser
will show `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`.

1. Open the **Images** tab and click **Run** on `irving1flores/homeledger`.
2. Expand **Optional settings**.
3. Under **Ports**, set **Host port** to `3000` (the container listens on
   `3000`). Without this step the container runs but is not reachable from your
   browser.
4. *(Optional)* Add a volume so your data survives restarts: **Host path** a
   folder of your choice, **Container path** `/data`.
5. *(Optional)* Under **Environment variables**, set `DEFAULT_LOCALE` to `en` or
   `es` for the starting language, and `DISPLAY_CURRENCY` (e.g. `USD`, `MXN`) for
   the currency. You can also switch your language later in **Settings**.
6. Click **Run**, then open <http://localhost:3000>.

Log in with the demo credentials:

- **Email:** `admin@homeledger.local`
- **Password:** `changeme123`

> :information_source: `EXPOSE 3000` in the image only documents the port; it
> does not publish it. Docker Desktop only maps it when you set a Host port
> (step 3), which is equivalent to `-p 3000:3000` on the command line.
>
> :warning: **These defaults are insecure and public.** For any real
> deployment, override `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (in
> Optional settings → Environment variables, or with the `-e` flags shown
> above).

**Option 2 — Build from source with Docker Compose**

```bash
# Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/TastingRogue/HomeLedger.git
cd HomeLedger
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set JWT_SECRET + ADMIN_PASSWORD (required), and optionally
# DEFAULT_LOCALE (en|es) and DISPLAY_CURRENCY (MXN|USD|…). Compose reads .env,
# so this file — not -e flags — is where you configure this deployment.

# Start with Docker Compose (backend on 3000, frontend on 5173)
docker compose up -d
```

## Environment Variables

The Docker image ships with insecure demo defaults so it runs out of the box.
Override these in production.

| Variable | Description | Default (Docker image) |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for signing tokens (min 32 chars) | insecure demo value — **change in production** |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Comma-separated allowed origins; unset reflects the request origin | unset (reflect origin) |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Admin user email | `admin@homeledger.local` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin password | `changeme123` — **change in production** |
| `ALLOW_INSECURE_DEFAULTS` | Allow booting in production with the insecure demo `JWT_SECRET`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` (logs a loud warning). If unset, the app **refuses to start** in production on insecure values. The demo image sets this so it runs out of the box. | `true` (Docker image) · unset (local) |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | Trust `X-Forwarded-*` from a reverse proxy so `request.ip` (rate limiting/logging) is the real client. Set to `true` when behind Nginx/Traefik/Caddy; leave unset for direct connections. | unset (disabled) |
| `DEFAULT_LOCALE` | Primary language for the install (the language each user's default categories are seeded in at sign-up, and the UI's default language before any user picks one): `es` or `en`. Users can still switch their own language and rename/delete their own categories. | `en` (falls back to English if unset/invalid) |
| `DISPLAY_CURRENCY` | The install's single currency (`MXN`, `USD`, `EUR`, `COP`, `ARS`, `CLP`, `PEN`, `BRL`). All amounts use it — HomeLedger v1 is single-currency (no conversion). Admin can change it in-app. | `MXN` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Server log verbosity (pino): `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`, `silent` | `info` |
| `TZ` | Timezone | `America/Mexico_City` |
| `PORT` | Server port (app + API) | `3000` |
| `DATA_DIR` | Persistent data directory: SQLite database **and** uploaded attachments (`$DATA_DIR/attachments`) | `/data` (Docker) · `./data` (local) |
| `BACKUP_ENABLED` | Enable the scheduled backup job (gzip whole-DB snapshots under `$DATA_DIR/backups`) | `true` |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION` | How many snapshots to keep; older ones are rotated out | `7` |
| `BACKUP_CRON` | Cron schedule for automated backups (server timezone) | `0 3 * * *` (daily 03:00) |
| `REGISTRATION_MODE` | Who may register: `first_user_only` (safe default — first user bootstraps admin, then closed), `open`, or `closed`. Admin can change it in-app; env only seeds the initial value. | `first_user_only` |
| `REGISTRATION_ALLOWLIST` | Optional comma-separated email allowlist; when set and mode is `open`, only these emails may register | unset (no allowlist) |

> :floppy_disk: **Data persistence.** Everything under `DATA_DIR` — the database
> and receipt/invoice attachments — lives on the `homeledger-data` volume, so it
> survives `docker compose up --build --force-recreate` and container rebuilds.
> Deleting the volume (`docker compose down -v`) is what wipes your data.

## Account Recovery (locked out?)

If you forget the admin password, disable the only admin, or somehow end up with
no admin, use the built-in **admin recovery CLI**. It runs directly against the
database (no email needed) and works headless, so you can always regain access
**without wiping your data**.

```bash
# Docker (against a running container):
docker exec -it homeledger node dist/cli/admin.js list-users
docker exec -it homeledger node dist/cli/admin.js reset-password admin@homeledger.local
# ^ prints a new strong password once. Or pass your own:
docker exec -it homeledger node dist/cli/admin.js reset-password admin@homeledger.local 'MyNewPassw0rd'

# Local (from the repo root):
npm run admin -w packages/backend -- list-users
npm run admin -w packages/backend -- reset-password admin@homeledger.local
```

Commands: `list-users`, `reset-password <email> [password]`,
`create-admin <email> [password] [name]`, `promote <email>` (make a user admin),
`enable <email>` (re-enable a disabled account). If you omit the password, a
strong one is generated and printed once — copy it, then change it in-app.

> An admin who **can** log in can also reset another user's password from the
> app (admin user-management). The CLI is the fallback for when nobody can log in.
>
> :email: **Email-based reset (optional, not built in):** HomeLedger is
> local-first and ships no SMTP dependency, so there is no "email me a reset
> link" flow by default. The CLI above is the supported recovery path. An
> optional SMTP flow could be added later for setups that want it.

## Upgrading

Upgrades are designed to be safe: your data lives on the `homeledger-data`
volume (see above), and the app brings the database schema up to date
automatically on startup.

```bash
# Prebuilt image
docker pull irving1flores/homeledger:latest
docker stop homeledger && docker rm homeledger
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v homeledger-data:/data \
  -e JWT_SECRET="..." --name homeledger irving1flores/homeledger:latest

# Docker Compose (from source)
git pull
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
```

On boot the backend runs any pending Drizzle migrations and reconciles a couple
of columns that are managed idempotently (`attachments.transfer_id` /
`original_name` and their index). Running an old database against a newer image
is safe — schema changes are additive and applied automatically; no manual
migration step is required.

> :bulb: **Always keep a backup before upgrading.** Use **Settings → Data &
> Backup → Export** (or the `/api/v1/backup/export` endpoint) so you can restore
> if something goes wrong. Backup import remaps ids safely, so a restore never
> collides with existing data.

## Deployment & operations

For putting HomeLedger on the public internet safely, see
**[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)**:

- **Reverse proxy + HTTPS** — copy-pasteable configs for Caddy (automatic TLS),
  Nginx (+ certbot), and Traefik (Docker labels), plus the `TRUST_PROXY` /
  `CORS_ORIGIN` wiring for running behind a proxy.
- **Backup & restore / disaster recovery** — the three mechanisms (per-user JSON
  export/import with preview, automated whole-DB gzip snapshots + in-app restore,
  and volume-level tar), and which to use when.
- **Upgrading & rolling back**, and account recovery.

## API Endpoints

Base URL: `/api/v1` — Auth via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-API-Key: <key>`.

| Resource | Methods |
|----------|---------|
| `/auth` | register, login, refresh, logout, me (GET/PUT), change-password, revoke-all-sessions |
| `/users` *(admin)* | list, enable/disable, delete, reset-password, registration policy (GET/PUT), instance currency (GET/PUT) |
| `/accounts` | CRUD + deactivate |
| `/transactions` | CRUD + quick create + split + **CSV export** (`/export.csv`) |
| `/transfers` | CRUD (create, list, update, delete) |
| `/subscriptions` | CRUD + delete + calendar |
| `/goals` | CRUD + fund + withdraw |
| `/budgets` | CRUD + summary |
| `/loans` | CRUD + record payment + amortization schedule + payments |
| `/categories` | CRUD + subcategories + analysis |
| `/alerts` | list, mark read, mark all read, evaluate, delete, settings |
| `/reports` | dashboard, cashflow, trends, categories, budget-vs-actual |
| `/networth` | current, history, assets/liabilities CRUD |
| `/attachments` | upload, list, download, link, delete |
| `/receipts` | list, get, analyze attachment |
| `/imports` | upload, preview, confirm |
| `/backup` | export, import, preview (dry-run); snapshots list/create/restore *(admin)*; history |
| `/ha` | status, webhook, sensors |
| `/health` · `/config` | liveness probe (+ `/health/scheduler`, admin) · public runtime config |

> [!NOTE]
> As of **v1.0.0**, the `/api/v1` surface and the backup file format are
> **stable** under [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): no breaking
> changes within `1.x`. See **[docs/STABILITY.md](docs/STABILITY.md)** for
> exactly what's covered, what counts as an additive (non-breaking) change, and
> what would require a `2.0.0`.

## Scheduler Jobs

| Job | Schedule | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| Auto-charge | Daily 00:05 + on startup | Processes due subscriptions, catches up missed charges |
| Alert evaluation | Every hour + on startup | Evaluates all alert conditions for all users |
| Budget reset | Monthly (day 1, 00:10) | Resets budget periods |
| Backup snapshot | `BACKUP_CRON` (default daily 03:00) | Gzip whole-DB snapshot under `$DATA_DIR/backups` + retention rotation. Toggle with `BACKUP_ENABLED`. |

All four report into an in-memory status registry, visible to admins at
`GET /api/v1/health/scheduler`.

## Multi-currency & i18n

- **Currency**: **Single currency per install** (MXN, USD, EUR, COP, ARS, CLP, PEN, BRL), chosen by the admin via `DISPLAY_CURRENCY` (or the admin API). All amounts and totals use this one currency.
- **Language**: Spanish / English — switchable per user from Settings
- **Timezone**: America/Mexico_City (configurable in server environment)

> :information_source: **On currencies (v1):** HomeLedger v1 is **single-currency
> per install** — it does not convert between currencies, so mixing currencies is
> intentionally not supported (accounts must use the instance currency). Choosing
> a currency sets the symbol and unit for the whole install. **Multi-currency with
> conversion is planned post-1.0** (see the roadmap). Language is per-user.

## Home Assistant

HomeLedger ships with two independent Home Assistant pieces. You can use either
or both:

- **Add-on** (`ha-addon/`) — runs the whole HomeLedger app *inside* Home
  Assistant, with the web UI embedded in the HA sidebar via Ingress.
- **Custom integration** (`ha-integration/`, HACS) — connects to a running
  HomeLedger instance and exposes your finances as HA **sensors, binary
  sensors and services** for dashboards and automations.

### Option A — Add-on (run the app inside Home Assistant)

Requires Home Assistant OS or Supervised (the Supervisor must be available).

1. **Add the add-on repository**
   - Go to **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store**.
   - Open the **⋮** menu (top-right) → **Repositories**.
   - Add the repository URL:
     ```
     https://github.com/TastingRogue/HomeLedger
     ```
   - Click **Add**, then close the dialog.
2. **Install** — find **HomeLedger** in the store and click **Install** (the
   image is multi-arch: `amd64` and `aarch64`/arm64, so it runs on x86 servers
   and 64-bit Raspberry Pi).
3. **Configure** — open the add-on's **Configuration** tab and set at least:

   | Option | Required | Notes |
   |--------|----------|-------|
   | `JWT_SECRET` | **Yes** | Min 32 chars; use a strong random value |
   | `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | **Yes** | Password for the initial admin user |
   | `ADMIN_EMAIL` | No | Defaults to `admin@homeledger.local` |
   | `TZ` | No | Defaults to `America/Mexico_City` |

4. **Start** — go to the **Info** tab and click **Start**. Enable **Show in
   sidebar** for one-click access.
5. **Open** — launch it from the HA sidebar (Ingress), or directly at
   `http://<HA_IP>:3000`, and log in with the admin credentials you set.

Data is stored under `/data` (SQLite DB + attachments) and is included in Home
Assistant backups.

### Option B — Custom integration via HACS (finance sensors in HA)

Use this to pull HomeLedger data into HA. It works with **any** running
HomeLedger instance — the add-on above, a Docker deployment, etc. It polls
locally every 5 minutes (no cloud).

**Prerequisites:** a running HomeLedger instance reachable from HA, and an
**API key** generated in HomeLedger (used as a Bearer token).

1. **Add the repository to HACS**
   - In HACS, open the **⋮** menu → **Custom repositories**.
   - Repository: `https://github.com/TastingRogue/HomeLedger`
   - Category: **Integration** → **Add**.
2. **Install** the *HomeLedger* integration from HACS, then **restart Home
   Assistant**.
3. **Add the integration** — go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add
   Integration**, search for **HomeLedger**, and fill in:
   - **API URL** — e.g. `http://<HA_IP>:3000` (add-on) or your instance URL.
   - **API key** — the key generated in HomeLedger.
   - **Name** *(optional)* — a friendly label.

   The setup validates the connection against `/api/v1/ha/status`, so a wrong
   URL or key is reported immediately.

**Entities created:**

- **Sensors:** monthly expenses, monthly income, monthly savings, remaining
  budget, net worth, total balance, credit card utilization.
- **Binary sensors:** over budget, high credit utilization, payment due soon,
  low balance.

**Services** (callable from automations/scripts):

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `homeledger.create_transaction` | Create an income/expense (name, amount, type, account_id, category_id) |
| `homeledger.create_quick_expense` | Quick expense (amount, account_id, category_id) |
| `homeledger.refresh_data` | Force a data refresh |

Example: notify when a subscription payment is due soon, or when credit
utilization is high, using the binary sensors as automation triggers.

## Development

Prefer to run from source (Node) instead of Docker? You'll need **Node.js ≥ 20**
(Docker images build on Node 22) and **npm ≥ 9**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TastingRogue/HomeLedger.git
cd HomeLedger
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # edit it — JWT_SECRET is required (min 32 chars)

npm run dev:backend           # API on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev:frontend          # Frontend on http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api to 3000)
```

The first user you register becomes the admin; the SQLite database is created
automatically on first run. See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the
full contributor guide (conventions, testing, migrations, and a two-step guide
to **adding a language**).

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev:backend       # Backend with hot-reload (tsx watch)
npm run dev:frontend      # Frontend with Vite HMR
npm run build             # Build shared + backend + frontend
npm run test              # Run all tests (Vitest, backend + frontend)
npm run lint              # Lint all packages
npm run format            # Format with Prettier
npm run db:generate -w packages/backend   # Generate a migration
npm run db:migrate  -w packages/backend   # Apply migrations
```

Before opening a PR, make sure these pass from the repo root:

```bash
npm run typecheck -w packages/backend    # tsc --noEmit
npm run typecheck -w packages/frontend   # svelte-check (expect 0 errors, 0 warnings)
npm run test                             # full monorepo suite
npm run build                            # full build
```

### Applying code changes (Docker rebuild)

> :warning: **The Docker images bake the source at build time — they do not
> mount your working copy.** After changing backend or frontend code you **must
> rebuild the image**, or the container keeps running the old code. (Compose only
> mounts `/data`, never the source.)

```bash
# Docker Compose (dev): rebuild + recreate with the new code.
# --force-recreate replaces the running containers; the homeledger-data volume
# (your DB) is preserved. No need to stop/remove anything first.
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
docker compose ps            # confirm both containers are healthy

# Standalone image:
docker build -t homeledger:standalone .
docker rm -f homeledger
docker run -d --name homeledger -p 3000:3000 -v homeledger-data:/data homeledger:standalone
```

**Publishing to Docker Hub:** commit to `main` and push — the GitHub Actions
workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`) rebuilds and pushes automatically.

**Notes for specific changes:**

- **Receipt OCR:** results are cached in the DB. After changing the parser,
  existing receipts keep their old values until you press **Re-analyze** in the
  receipt popup (or restore a backup).
- **New tables created outside Drizzle** (raw SQL, like `receipt_analyses`): also
  clear them in `BackupService.import()` so a restore wipes them like the rest.
- **New env vars:** add a sensible default in the `Dockerfile` (for zero-config
  run) and document them in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) table.
